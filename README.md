# 👋 Hey there, I’m @m1kedee or you can cal  Mike D.

### 🙋‍♂️ About Me 
 I created a GitHub to share scripts and projects I'm working on or learning to help others bootstrap the process of growing into a DevOps engineer or just looking to learn new skills! I’m currently a Senior Cloud Engineer specializing in Amazon Web Services and have been in the DevOps space for the past couple of years. I’m always looking for ways to learn and grow not only in my career but in my personal life as well. I am currently learning a couple of programming languages, more specifically, Python and Go. I have experience in Powershell, Bash, HTML/CSS, and some Vanilla Javascript.

### 📚 Topics
I will be covering DevOps workflow and projects. Topics may include Infrastructure as Code with [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), Infrastructure Configuration with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works) and [Packer](https://www.packer.io/), CI/CD with [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/platform/?stage=plan), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), and tying them all together in AWS for end-to-end deployment. So if you're as excited to learn and grow as I am, stay tuned for some awesome projects. I will also put together some scripts and automation and also general scripts and programs to automate some of the boring day-to-day stuff to help us streamline our workflows and make life a little more convenient.
